    \n\n
    We needed a simple to use, easy to extend [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)
    signaling server that communicated over regular old `HTTP/1.1` for
    [3dtoolkit](https://github.com/catalystcode/3dtoolkit) - this is it. It's
    designed to mirror [the WebRTC example
    server](https://github.com/svn2github/webrtc/tree/master/talk/examples/peerconnection/server)
    at an API level, while allowing developers to consume and extend the base
    functionality."

      description: >-
        Provides a mechanism for simulated server push, using vanilla http long
        polling. That is, the TCP socket behind this request will remain open to
        the server until there is content the server needs to send. In the event
        of a TCP timeout the client should reconnect. Messages that contain a
        `Pragma` value that matches the client `peer_id` are peer status updates
        and should be handled the same as the status update provided in the `GET
        /sign_in` response. `Content-Type` headers will not reflect the type of
        the original content.
